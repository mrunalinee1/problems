Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
         int n = nums.size();
        int total_count = 0;

        std::vector<std::unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                long d = static_cast<long>(nums[i]) - nums[j]; 

                if (d > INT_MAX || d < INT_MIN)
                    continue; 

                int d_int = static_cast<int>(d);

                dp[i][d_int] += 1; 

                if (dp[j].count(d_int)) {
                    dp[i][d_int] += dp[j][d_int];
                    total_count += dp[j][d_int];
                }
            }
        }

        return total_count;
    }
};
